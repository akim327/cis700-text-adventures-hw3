        "You may have observed when training that your validation accuracy goes up for a while and then eventually starts going down. This is called overfitting, because your model is learning to be really good at classifying examples from the training set at the expense of dong a good job at classifying usneen exampes in the validation set. You could prevent overfitting by automatically stopping training when the validation accuracy has not improved in X steps (where X is another hyperparamter you'd have to decide upon)."
